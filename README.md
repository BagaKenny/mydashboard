How I Worked Here!

- The Goal was to focus on Chart creation using different open Source libraries, Such As Chartist.js
- I took the design from the Repo of FrontEnd Joe, an Instagrammer
  >>> I worked with different API such as GeoJson, Google Maps and Fake Store
  
  This Was really an exercise for me as to know how to generate such Visuals and working with API
  
I learned a lot doing this!
